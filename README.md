# Linear Regression

This page demostrates some sample code for linear regression. Two Python files has been shared.

One is written from scratch without any Machine Learning libraries such as `scikit-learn`.

Other uses the capabilities of `scikit-learn` tools.

## Results

### Gradient Descend

'linear_regression.py' manages to decrease the cost and it converges as seen below.

### Accuracy

Using the same train and and test sets, the accuracy scores of both version:


|   | Accuracy |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Written from scratch  | 0.8324  |
| sklearn  | 0.8340  |
